            seraph_analysis: "S.E.R.A.P.H. Analysis: The primary threat is crowd dynamics, not an antagonist. The mission requires an asset with proven leadership capabilities and a strong public image to perform command, control, and de-escalation functions. A purely tactical or combat asset would be ineffective here."
