        "dossier": "Designated as the most advanced 'Cognivore' on record, Seraphim is less of a field combatant and more of a tactical nexus.

        "dossier": "The team's primary cognitive specialist, Mosaic operates as a forensic mind-reader capable of reconstructing past events by reading psychic residue left on people, objects, or locations. He does not engage in direct combat; instead, he unravels threats by listening to psychic echoes and emotional stains. He is never seen without his featureless, reflective mask, which is rumored to filter out excess mental 'noise'. His presence at a scene almost always brings clarity, uncovering hidden motives and lost connections."

By remaining perfectly still, Battery can store vast amounts of potential energy, which she can then discharge in violent bursts of speed, strength, and electromagnetism. Her combat style is mechanical and precise: she enters a field, remains motionless to assess and charge, and then ends the confrontation with terrifying efficiency. She has a military background and is known for her cold demeanor and for disobeying orders in favor of 'better timing'."

        "dossier": "A meteorological tactician who manipulates micro-atmospheric dynamics. Downdraft doesn't create storms; he weaponizes the air itself, creating sudden downdrafts, crosswinds, and pressure shifts to disorient enemies, deflect projectiles, and control the battlefield. An ex-atmospheric engineer, his power is about surgical control rather than brute force, making him a disorienting and elusive presence in urban environments. He is often accompanied by a custom climate-simulation drone nicknamed 'Nimbus'."

Her constructs, formed from a semi-sentient black and green energy, react to her intent and the moral weight of a situation, making her precision increase in high-stress ethical dilemmas. A philosophical and centered individual, she believes every weapon she creates is an external representation of a repressed emotion."

        "dossier": "The team's temporal specialist, Loop can create short-term 'echoes' of her own movements, striking multiple targets simultaneously or creating temporal duplicates to outmaneuver opponents. An ex-track athlete recruited by Battery, she is a relentless strategist and a merciless trash-talker. Her combat style is disorienting, with attacks seemingly violating linear time. She often fights with headphones on, which fans theorize helps her maintain her temporal rhythm."

Viceroy's power lies in precision: with a single touch, he can subtly alter an opponent's muscle responses, redirecting their momentum, causing them to lose balance, and neutralizing conflict before it can escalate.

If the rest of the team is jazz, he is the metronome: steady, focused, and unerringly precise. He avoids the spotlight and believes actions, especially his, speak louder than words."
